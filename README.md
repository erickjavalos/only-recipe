# Only Recipes

## Description

The purpose of this application is to allow users to create a profile in our application that tracks recipes. The application
allows users to create a profile, sign in, and add a recipe of their choice. 

Upon entering a recipe, the user is prompted to input ingredients, a step by step process, prep time/cook time, and other options.

The future product will allow users to follow other accounts and favorite recipes of their interest!
